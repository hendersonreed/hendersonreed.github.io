# User Interactions and Mindsets

Our emotional states are a huge part of our computing experience, but this aspect of interaction design seems to be an oft-overlooked one. I'd like to change that, and in pursuit of that goal I've been thinking a lot about the various mindsets that different interactions produce.


## brainstorming tools

Why do brainstorming tools exist separate from other textual interfaces? Try opening [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) and poking at it. It feels... flexible. Like there are no constraints on what could be represented in it - mind-maps, lists, diagrams, flowcharts, any of these are straightforward to build. And combinations of those forms are easy too - the boundaries between categories of knowledge structures are fluid in the nebulosity of the infinite canvas.

Sorry - I've appear to have fallen into a phenomological mindset just thinking about the freedom afforded by Excalidraw.

Anyways, the same actual *interactions* are available in, say, Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. You can build a list, or a mindmap of grouped items, or a diagram. You could do the same in vim, with plain text. Inputting or removing text, moving it around, drawing connections. That's all that any of these tools do. It might be a little slower, but then again, maybe not if you're proficient with those tools or have plugins or accessory tools that augment your interactions.

So, why do folks build brainstorming applications, if what we have is enough?


## social media

Have you ever noticed that, no matter which platform you end up on, people are doing the same things? Sharing glib or funny one-liners, posting pictures, sparring in the comments, this is the bread and butter of what social media *is*.

So why do they *feel* so different? What separates TikTok from Instagram from Youtube from Facebook, from a features perspective? Not much, I say. This is especially obvious as one platform develops a new capability and all the others jump on the bandwagon to re-implement it. See TikTok and the subsequent spawning of Youtube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and whatever the hell Facebook is offering.

Sure, you could say it's all about the people or communities that pick one platform or another, that the interfaces are a red herring. But that's the same question in a different guise - what made those people or communities pick one platform over the other?


## DAWs

For decades now, people have been refining the tools used to build music with computers, culminating in the all-powerful DAW (digital audio workstation.)

Have you ever seen a DAW? [See it and weep.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation#/media/File:Ardour_6.7_Recorder_Editor_Mixer.png)

Consider the mindset a tool like a DAW might induce, and compare it to the mindset induced by even the most technical of commonly taught instruments, like a piano or a violin. It's far easier, in my experience, to noodle and learn a little ditty on a violin, even if it takes more time to sound passable.


## in summation:

I think a primary factor in how we pick our tools is the mindsets they place upon us. How these "places" make you *feel*. Our feelings are an intense aspect of our personal experiences, one that lives beneath our conscious post-facto rationalizations of our decisions and thoughts.

If you build software, how do your users *feel*? Do they feel empowered, capable, and knowledgable? It doesn't matter if your tool is perfectly polished with no bugs and has all the affordances and features your users could ever want. If your users feel frustrated, precarious, incapable, mystified, or in any number of other positions, then I think you have no shot[^1].
