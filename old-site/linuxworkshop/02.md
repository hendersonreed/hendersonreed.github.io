### Getting Down to Business

First and foremost, some points for context:

The Linux command-line shell is typically going to be BASH. Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell.  
It's an open source clone of the UNIX Bourne Shell, written by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs in 1979

Importantly, the shell is an interpreter for the BASH scripting language!  
	* This means we can write programs in BASH.
	* Because the Linux environment is written with BASH in mind, they can work together very nicely.

Let's see an example!
