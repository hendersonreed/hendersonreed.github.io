# introduction

Purpose: How do we take the command-line from being a hassle, to being an ally?

## topics
1. BASH scripting, functions, and configuration.
2. general command-line tips and tricks.
	a. using the manual pages!
	b. grep and find to locate files
	c. using the bash history effectively
	c. misc 
3. Q&A session - ask me questions about Linux!

### setting up our environment:

Firstly, all these files are available at the following URL:  
web.cecs.pdx.edu/~hhummel/linuxworkshop/

If you navigate there, you can download all of these "slides", as well as any of the scripts I run here.  
You can also do this by issuing the following curl command:  
	curl -O https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~hhummel/linuxworkshop/workshop_slides.tar

I would recommend downloading at least the scripts, denoted by the ".sh" file extension.
