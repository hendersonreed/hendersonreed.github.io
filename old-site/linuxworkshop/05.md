### Bash Configuration
Just like Vim has a .vimrc file, BASH has a .bashrc. 
	* In it you can set things like your command-line prompt, colors, and BASH functions and aliases.

#### Functions?
Yes, BASH has functions, just like other programming languages! 
	* When you include them in a .bashrc file, you can then call them from any directory, 
	  just like a standard utility.

#### Aliases?
Aliases are a way to assign short names to long commands.
For example, if you are always navigating to ~/some/directory/deep/in/the/file/tree/
you can simply make an alias.
>	ex. `alias longdir="cd ~/some/directory/deep/in/the/file/tree/"
