### Adding permissions to execute:
In order to actually run your script, you need to give it permission to run.
>	run "chmod +x <filename>" in order to do so.

### Moving On:
In the script we just looked at, you might have noticed the '>' being used.

	
There are 3 primary redirect operators:
>	`>`
>	`>>`
>	`|`

`>` redirects the standard output into a file, overwriting anything already there.  
`>>` appends the output to a file.  
`|` connects the standard output of one command to the standard input of the following command.  

ex.
>	`echo hello world > hw.txt`
>	`ls /usr/bin | grep "record"`
