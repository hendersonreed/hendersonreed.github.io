#### using grep and find to locate files
In order to locate a file using its name, use the `find` tool.
>	ex. `find ~/ -name "*.c"`

In order to locate a file based upon it's contents, we can use `grep`
>	ex. `grep -ilR somevar .`
		* -i # case insensitivity
		* -l # list files, not matches.
		* -R # search recursively.
