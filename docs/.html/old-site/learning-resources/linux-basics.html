		<h4>Navigating the Directory Tree</h4>
      <p>
        Though you may not know it, you already have navigated systems very like the Linux directory system. It's a folder tree much like you may have encountered on Windows or MacOSX, but instead of having a graphical window open and clicking to move from folder to folder, you are interacting with it through a command-line interface. As a result, you must use certain commands to do what you would ordinarily do with clicking and dragging.
        <ul>
          <li> <code>ls</code> - print the contents of the current directory.</li>
          <li> <code>cd &lt;dir&gt;</code> - if dir is in the current directory, move to it.</li>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>cd ..</code> - move up one directory.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that you can provide <code>ls</code> and <code>cd</code> with what we call "paths." These are descriptions of locations in the filesystem. For example, when you log into the Linux system at PSU, you begin in your <b>home directory</b>. The path to your home directory is <code>/home/&lt;your username&gt;/</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Linux utilities (we refer to small programs like <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> as <b>utilities</b>) that take files as arguments can also be given entire paths, including paths that refer to things by working upwards in the file tree with "..".
      </p>

      <p>
      Here's a simplified diagram of the Linux file tree:
      </p>

      <p>
      What command would move you from <code>/home/hhummel/website</code> to <code>/home/sam</code>? Hover over the spoiler box below to check the correct answer.
      </p>

      <span class="spoiler">
        <code class="spoiler">cd ../../sam<br>
        cd /home/sam</code><br>
      </span>

		<h4>Moving and Copying Files</h4>
    <p><b>warning: these commands, if improperly performed could harm files. If you are unsure, contact a tutor or the #cshelp channel on <a href="https://pdx-cs.slack.com">the pdx-cs slack channel</a>. If something goes wrong, you can contact the <a href="https://cat.pdx.edu">PSU CAT</a> for a backup of your work.</b></p>
      <p>
      The <code>mv</code> comand moves a file from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files by simply giving it two names, instead of two locations.
      <ul>
        <li><code>mv &lt;source file&gt; &lt;new location&gt;</code><br></li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      Another useful command for backing up files or making copies of files in other directories is <code>cp</code>. The usage for cp is fairly simplistic:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><code>cp &lt;source file&gt; &lt;destination for copy&gt;</code><br></li>
        <li><code>cp -r &lt;source directory&gt; &lt;destination for copy&gt;</code><br></li>
        <ul>
          <li> this command will copy an entire directory (and everything inside it) to the location.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      </p>
		<h4>Archiving Files for D2L Submission</h4>
      <p>
      Just like the above commands, improper usage of these commands could harm your files, so the same warning applies.
      </p>
      <p>
      To archive your files (wrap them all up in one large file), we use <code>tar</code>:
      <ul>
        <li><code>tar -cvf example.tar directory-to-tar/</code></li>
          <ul>
            <li> the -c means to <b>c</b>ompress.</li>
            <li> the -v means to display <b>v</b>erbosely.</li>
            <li> the -f means to produce a <b>f</b>ile.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      </p>
		<h4>Basic Vim Configuration</h4>
      <p>
      If you want to make vim a slightly more friendly place, simply create a file named <code>.vimrc</code> in your home directory. Inside that file, you can do the following:
      <ul>
        <li><code>syntax enable</code> syntax highlighting.</li>
        <li><code>set number</code> line numbering.</li>
        <li><code>set autoindent</code> continue the indentation of the previous line.</li>
        <li><code>set smartindent</code> syntax-aware indentation rules (you want both this and autoindent.)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
