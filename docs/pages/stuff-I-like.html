<ul>
<li>3M Transpore Tape
<ul>
<li>I came across a roll of this when poking through my local eco-recycling shop. It’s designed for surgical use, but it’s got all kinds of awesome uses. It’s semi-stretchy, semi-transparent, and quite strong, with great attachement to both man-made synthetic surfaces like plastics, but also skin and other organic surfaces like wood and cardboard.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Jinhao fountain pens
<ul>
<li>There are a huge number of models made by Jinhao, but I particularly like the 51A (a clone of the vintage Parker 51) and the 80 (inspired by the Lamy 2000). Both of these are available shipped for less than $10, and, because they are inspired by famous vintage pens, the actual ergonomics of them are top tier. Make sure to clean them well before filling with ink, but besides that, I think you’re golden. I own pens that sell for 100 times as much as these cost nearly (though I didn’t pay nearly that much thank goodness), and I pick these for day-to-day writing ahead of all of them, because they’re reliable and I don’t have to worry about hurting them.</li>
</ul></li>
