<p>I’ve been getting so many ideas lately, I’ve been forced to write them down so I can stop thinking about them for a little bit. Find them at <a href="todo.html">todo</a></p>
<p>I’m working on building more projects I’m proud to share with the world. For now, here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="snow-hands/">snow-hands</a>: this is a little project I put together for a holiday event. The idea is to set it up on a projector, and point a webcam at the projector setup, so that the snowflakes can follow your hands in real time. To test it out, just open the page, click the screen, and once you’ve allowed webcam access just slowly wave your hands within view of the webcam.</li>
<li><a href="hark.html">hark: a literature visualizer</a>.
<ul>
<li>this is a little script that visualizes recurring 4/5/6-word phrases in a given piece of literature. Some public domain text is included as an example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hendersonreed/psg.py">psg: python site generator</a>
<ul>
<li>this is the primary tool used to build this site. There are a few additional scripts tracked alongside the website source itself for things like backing-up-and-resizing images and generating the page sitemap, but <code>psg</code> is the biggest part.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="/posts/2023-10-23-building-pyplot.html">pyplot: for poking at vintage plotters</a>
<ul>
<li>this is a small utility I wrote for feeding larger HPGL files into vintage plotters with limited buffer size.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>p5.js experimenting:
<ul>
<li><a href="colorworm.html">colorworm!!</a>
<ul>
<li>This was created as part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">exquisite corpse</a> with me and my friend <a href="https://lucaslija.github.io/">Lucas</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="colordrops.html">colordrops</a>
<ul>
<li>In building a regular creative practice, I’ve been trying to churn out more little unfinished pieces. colordrops is one.</li>
<li>These little colorful circles seem to induce a playful mood for most people. This one is not as interactive as colorworm, which means it doesn’t quite get you into the “zone” the way colorworm does.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
