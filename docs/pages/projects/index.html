<p>I’ve been getting so many ideas lately, I’ve been forced to write them down so I can stop thinking about them for a little bit. Find them at <a href="todo.html">todo</a></p>
<p>I’m working on building more projects I’m proud to share with the world. For now, here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="hark.html">hark: a literature visualizer</a>.
<ul>
<li>this is a little script that visualizes recurring 4/5/6-word phrases in a given piece of literature. Some public domain text is included as an example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hendersonreed/psg.py">psg: python site generator</a>
<ul>
<li>this is the primary tool used to build this site. There are a few additional scripts tracked alongside the website source itself for things like backing-up-and-resizing images and generating the page sitemap, but <code>psg</code> is the biggest part.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="/posts/2023-10-23-building-pyplot.html">pyplot: for poking at vintage plotters</a>
<ul>
<li>this is a small utility I wrote for feeding larger HPGL files into vintage plotters with limited buffer size.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>p5.js experimenting:
<ul>
<li><a href="colorworm.html">colorworm!!</a>
<ul>
<li>This was created as part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">exquisite corpse</a> with me and my friend <a href="https://lucaslija.github.io/">Lucas</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="colorswarm.html">colorswarm</a>
<ul>
<li>in trying to build a regular creative practice, I’ve been trying to churn out more little unfinished pieces. Colorswarm is just a bit more of that.</li>
<li>These little colorful circles seem to induce a playful mood for most people. This one is not as interactive as colorworm, which means it doesn’t quite get you into the “zone” the way colorworm does.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
