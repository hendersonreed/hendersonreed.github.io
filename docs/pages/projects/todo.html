<h1 id="project-ideas">project ideas</h1>
<p>These are projects I had to write down to get out of my head. Are you interested in collaborating? Are you working on these things? Email me!</p>
<ul>
<li>3D printed fipple flute adapter.
<ul>
<li>The difficult geometry of the fipple itself can be 3D printed, and then it clamps like a collet onto standard galvanized steel electrical conduit with fingerholes drilled into them. This makes producing a family of tin whistles in different keys straightforward.</li>
<li>Remains to be seen if steel conduit is an adequate resonator for this type of instrument. If not, copper plumbing pipe would serve just as well, but is more expensive (rougly 3x as much.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>selenite orb lamp
<ul>
<li>you can buy spheres made of selenite, a beautifully diffuse mineral, for ~$45. Pop it in a wooden stand, with some RGB LEDs embedded in the bottom and you have a pretty neat mood lamp I think.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>music discovery interface that emphasizes the things that are appealing about physical media.
<ul>
<li>an active hunt for new discoveries, not just an IV-drip of algorithmically selected music. This is also something that (I’m told) piracy had in the olden days.</li>
<li>physicality</li>
<li>accidental discoveries and surprises.</li>
<li>I’m thinking something that uses round aluminum NFC tags, with labels stuck to them. Place them in the “player”. Also some are “radio stations” while others are albums. Some physical interface for saving a currently playing song to a new tag, like a sort of “clone” so that you can physically “record” a mixtape from other albums/radio streams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>text generator/filter for old Dymo style labels</li>
<li>3D printed drone flute
<ul>
<li>two flutes in the same key, smashed side by side. One has pentatonic minor fingering, the other is just the root with no finger holes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>color draping demo that masks out your background (keeping just your face) and cycles colors behind it, letting you save colors you really like/dislike.</li>
<li>a little calendar you can put on your website that. It should read a simple text file to populate events, and produce also an RSS feed. A tool to convert .ico files and append them to the text file would be nice too.</li>
<li>generative art webpage that uses microphone to generate art based on your breathing rate.</li>
<li>Random pattern generator for inkle looms and css border</li>
<li>Visual poem webpage</li>
<li>node-based interface for stringing together LLM workflows</li>
<li>pizzaman: a silly little platformer where you play as a pizza pie. Maybe you shoot pizza slices, which means your health goes lower? and then powerups are toppings! and you get health from defeating enemies, who turn into little pizza slices when they die.</li>
<li>free-for-all bananagrams where you just try to write words from your available letters as fast as possible, but other people can steal letters from you?</li>
<li>plug-n-play projector + camera for interactive whiteboard
<ul>
<li>use google mediapipe api to detect hand gestures that trigger keypresses, e.g. an “OK” sign or “pinch” sign is a mouse-down action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>node-based CAD with jscad and react-flow</li>
<li>m-track: midi tape interface with Rust and iced.
<ul>
<li>see the project directory for documentation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>stellody (stella (star), melody) (using p5.js)
<ul>
<li>a simple application that plays music inspired/controlled by the stars that are passing directly overhead at the current time/longitude.</li>
<li>https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/ might be the tool</li>
<li>using azimuth calculations I think?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Personal Relationship Assistant (PRA)
<ul>
<li>accepts
<ul>
<li>info about a person and contact details,</li>
<li>optimal communication cadence</li>
<li>a collection of user writing samples, to allow generation of templates in users voice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>pings the user to let them know it’s time to reach out. Will expire within 1 week (to encourage urgency.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>script-enabled OSM app that notifies you of things you like within configured range</li>
<li>bee flappy-bird where you play kazoo to raise the bee</li>
<li>4-directional vvvvvv</li>
<li>game with mirrored boards as game mechanic</li>
<li>generalized interactive-map program (rust)
<ul>
<li>accepts a set of <code>execute</code> functions</li>
<li>accepts a <code>preview</code> function</li>
<li>accepts stdin</li>
<li>for each line in stdin, runs the preview function with it as an argument.
<ul>
<li>waits for user input, depending on input will run one of the given execute functions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>optional flag “confirm” that requires a <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> after each key command.</li>
<li>can also produce a script as output that runs the commands selected for the lines of stdin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>bitmap-to-midi converter. A “bitmap musicbox”, p5.js
<ul>
<li>needs to accept a csv, as well as a definition of what headings go to which sound things and which plot things.</li>
<li>can also define a <code>data-&gt;csv</code> conversion, so you can use an actual bitmap file format, for example. but converting to CSV is easiest.</li>
<li>allows uploading/pasting a file so you can paste any bitmap</li>
</ul></li>
<li>art history game, mapping images to artistic movements. scored based on speed of categorization and correctness</li>
<li>pigeon shitting game (you play as the pigeon)
<ul>
<li>eat powerups (pizza = shit better, bagel = another life, etc etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>microphone based breath controller for midi</li>
<li>piano tuning webgame</li>
<li>web instrument that interactively/intuitively teaches music practice/theory</li>
<li>chain together multiple LLMs for icon design
<ul>
<li>LLM for source image, LLM for style image, plus a model to do style application</li>
<li>“a save icon, black and white” x “van gogh’s starry night”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>hmmm an arithmetic language for model application?
<ul>
<li>each model needs a type, that defines what kind of inputs/outputs it produces.</li>
<li>operators that imply things like style application, wrapping in a prompt, etc etc.</li>
<li>what’s the analogue for “multiplication”, “addition”, “subtraction”, etc in this context?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>constrainted writing wordle/contact
<ul>
<li>I particularly like the idea of using chaucer or saxon/roman word restrictions. Or things like avoiding <code>e</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ambient noise representation with LED strips</li>
<li>theremidi - midi theremin</li>
<li>AST viewer nvim-plugin using mermaid.js and tree-sitter</li>
<li>markdown extension for conjure that allows executing the code inside code blocks</li>
<li>OmniChord emulator/inspired instrument.</li>
<li>midi harp</li>
<li>pen plotter portrait tool
<ul>
<li>uses a live feed and maybe some AI image filters?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>VJ interface inspired by vim registers.
<ul>
<li>config file defines imported video/music and saved registers (can load at runtime too.)</li>
<li>type a command and then hit <code>@&lt;register&gt;</code> to trigger the command with that data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>wiki web server that supports using any markup conversion</li>
<li>knitting machine that produces one scarf every year</li>
<li>CSS framework inspired by
<ul>
<li>NYC subway station tilework</li>
<li>mondrian</li>
</ul></li>
<li>messing around with https://crates.io/crates/nannou</li>
<li>moondog inspired sound playground, to teach working with odd time signatures, song structures, and modes.
<ul>
<li>random song structure of 4,8 bar segments</li>
<li>random mode</li>
<li>random time signature</li>
<li>everything else is customizeable.</li>
<li>includes a few basic sounds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
