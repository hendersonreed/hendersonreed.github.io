<h1 id="simple-rules-for-joining-us">4 simple rules for joining us:</h1>
<p>The goal here is to build a friendly, intellectually respectful,
productive space. So there are a few guidelines<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>No well-actually’s
<ul>
<li>A well-actually is when you interject to say something that’s not
relevant to the conversation or tangential to what someone else is
trying to say. They’re not helpful, they break the flow of conversation,
and they focus attention on the person making the well-actually.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No feigned surprise
<ul>
<li>feigning surprise is when you act surprised when someone doesn’t
know something. Responding with surprise in this situation makes people
feel bad for not knowing things and less likely to ask questions in the
future, which makes it harder for them to learn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No backseat driving
<ul>
<li>Backseat driving is when you lob advice from across the room (or
across the online chat) without really joining or engaging in a
conversation. Because you haven’t been participating in the
conversation, it’s easy to miss something important and give advice
that’s not actually helpful. Even if your advice is correct, it’s rude
to bust into a conversation without asking. If you overhear a
conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask
to join.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No subtle -isms
<ul>
<li>Subtle -isms are subtle expressions of bias and prejudice. They are
small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all
sometimes do by mistake.</li>
<li>“Python is so easy to use, even my mom can program with it!”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These social rules are lightweight. You should not be afraid of
breaking a social rule. These are things that everyone does, and
breaking one doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone says, “hey, you
just feigned surprise,” or “that’s subtly sexist,” don’t worry. Just
apologize, reflect for a second, and move on.</p>
