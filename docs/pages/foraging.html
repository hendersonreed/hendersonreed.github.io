<h1 id="foraging">Foraging</h1>
<p>I’ve long been interested in foraging. There’s something delightful about tramping through the forest and harvesting the bounties that litter the earth, so often unseen or ignored.</p>
<p>This page is a log of the more interesting foraging finds I’ve found, along with some not-really-artful photos.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert mycologist by any means, so treat these identifications with many grains of salt. If you think I’ve mis-identified any of these, please email me, and I am happy to update the identification if I agree.</p>
<p><em>note: do not attempt to teach yourself foraging. Find a local foraging group or mycological society and attend group forays and classes to learn the ropes. Even experienced mushroom hunters make mistakes, sometimes resulting in sickness or death.</em></p>
<h1 id="edibility-log">edibility log:</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Armillaria nabsnona</em>: tasty, like a richer and more flavorful shiitake.</li>
<li><em>Laetiporus conifericola</em>: initially caused painful stomach issues for me and a family member around 10 hours after consumption, probably due to being undercooked. On a second occasion I boiled the mushroom for ~15 minutes before consumption and found I had no issues. Good texture, flavor was OK but nothing special.</li>
<li><em>Suillus caerulescens</em>: a common mushroom in my neck of the woods, this one is quite tasty and I’ve never had a negative reaction, even when consuming the skin on the cap and pores (provided they’re young and firm.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="armillaria-sp.-perhaps-nabsnona-aka-honey-mushroom"><em>Armillaria sp.</em>, perhaps <em>nabsnona</em>, aka Honey Mushroom</h3>
<p>These are edible, and quite good - tasting like a deeper and richer shiitake. These do apparently cause gastric issues in some foragers, so thorough cooking is adviseable.</p>

<h3 id="western-grisette">Western Grisette</h3>
<p>A beautiful example of a fairly common <em>Amanita</em> in my area. These are apparently edible and good, but I avoid <em>Amanita</em> generally as they harbor multiple deadly poisonous species.</p>

<h3 id="hyphaloma">Hyphaloma</h3>
<p>A very common type, these are commonly known as <em>Sulphur Tuft</em>. By and large the genus is poisonous, but there is <em>Hyphaloma capnoides</em> which grows in my area and is edible - distinguishable by a spore print. I probably won’t ever eat these though - there are too many delicious and easy-to-identify mushrooms ahead of them on the list.</p>

<h2 id="early-october-2023">Early October, 2023</h2>
<p>According to the online foraging community, it’s the season for <em>Boletus edulis</em>, the King Bolete.</p>
<p>No luck on my end, but we did see:</p>
<ul>
<li>young Agaricus in town, in disturbed areas like mulched gardens and median strips.</li>
<li>a few young <em>Russula</em> specimens</li>
<li>many <em>Suillus</em>, many immature.</li>
<li>some <em>Gymonopilus</em>, fairly young.</li>
<li>some of what we think are <em>Lyophyllum decastes</em></li>
<li>many false chanterelles</li>
<li>and quite a few <em>Gerronema atrialbum</em> or at least that’s what I think it is.</li>
<li>some Angel Wings, <em>Pleurocybella porrigens</em>, which are an oyster-like species that, until recently, were considered good eating. In 2004 they caused some deaths in Japan. As a result, I don’t eat them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sharing any pictures today, but this log is mostly for me to track what I find and when/where. Mushrooms are so highly seasonal that week by week you watch a progression of fungi.</p>

<h3 id="odd-merged-boletacea">odd merged <em>Boletacea</em></h3>
<p>Likely <em>Xerocomellus</em>, these little guys appear to have merged early on.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/photos/mushrooms/merged-xerocomellus.jpg" title="two or three small velvety-capped mushrooms, with merged caps" /></p>
<h3 id="laetiporus-sp."><em>Laetiporus sp.</em></h3>
<p>This type is considered fine eating in Europe and the northeastern United States and commonly named one of the “foolproof four” (however, no foraged mushrooms are truly foolproof.) It <em>can</em> cause allergic reactions in some people, particularly the types that grow on the West Coast and those that grow on conifers on the East Coast.</p>
<p>This specimen was found on conifers in the Pacific Northwest and therefore is likely <em>Laetiporus conifericola</em>. I ate just a couple bites and felt a mild reaction, probably due to undercooking (it’s much meatier and denser than your typical choice edible mushroom, so requires more cooking than I thought.) Recommended practice is 15 minutes boiling, which I’ll be testing next.</p>

<h3 id="rubroboletus-pulcherrimus"><em>Rubroboletus pulcherrimus</em></h3>
<p>This genus is nearly all somewhat poisonous, and generally distinctive due to the red coloring, blue staining when bruised, and red pore surface. This particular species is one of the only Boletaceae that are known to have caused deaths (just two species in the family have ever been implicated in deaths.)</p>
