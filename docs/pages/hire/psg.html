<h1 id="psg-the-minimum-viable-site-generator">psg: the minimum viable site generator</h1>
<p>I use a site generator that is 99 lines of Python to generate this website. It has one dependency, <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a></p>
<p>There are other scripts that accessorize it, but the core functionality of building the site is done by <a href="https://github.com/hendersonreed/psg/blob/main/psg.py">this script</a>.</p>
<p>Questions you might have:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>why write your own, Reed, when there are <a href="https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators">so many site generators already?</a>.</li>
<li>what is handled by the other scripts? Isn’t it cheating to announce you have the minimum viable site generator and then use a bunch of other tools to patch over gaps in your initial design?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll try to answer those as best I can.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-decided-to-write-my-own">why I decided to write my own</h3>
<p>I never felt like I could understand any of the design decisions behind other generators, and for me, understanding the <em>why</em> behind something is just as important as understanding the <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, other generators often felt wedded to a type of working that didn’t jive with my own personal workflows.</p>
<p>I <em>can</em> write my own software. That’s an incredible thing! It’s fun to write software, it’s a source of creative expression for me, and it’s so fulfilling to use a tool that you made.</p>
<p>On top of that, I feel <em>far</em> more comfortable extending psg than say, Jekyll. I know every bit of psg! And if I forget it, I can read the sourcecode in 10 minutes and understand everything again.</p>
<p>The other aspect here is that building psg ultimately was <em>faster</em> than learning how to use any of these other tools. I spent probably 2 hours on it to begin with, and by the end I had something usable that I understood from top-to-bottom.</p>
<p>Speed and my own understanding were my requirements, and I’m the only stakeholder!</p>
<h3 id="what-other-tools-are-needed-to-complement-psg">what other tools are needed to complement psg?</h3>
<p>I’ve written a <a href="https://github.com/hendersonreed/hendersonreed.github.io/tree/master/tools">handful of scripts that live alongside the source for this site</a></p>
<p><code>cloc</code> reports that in total, there are 141 additional lines of code, in bash and Python.</p>
<p>These scripts do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>add unique page titles (this would be fixed with correctly using Pandoc templating.)</li>
<li>resize images for faster page-loading.</li>
<li>build a sitemap for navigation.</li>
<li>publish the site (cleans the build directory, rebuilds it from scratch, asks me for a commit message, and pushes to github.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-you-use-psg">should you use psg?</h2>
<p><em>For me</em>, psg is great. But I don’t think that means you should use it.</p>
<p>I think for people who like to craft their personal sites, a site generator is a personal tool, and is inextricably bound up with their ways of working.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, there’s a low chance anything off the shelf will satisfy your personal preferences. So, build your own! It’s an easier task than you might think.</p>
