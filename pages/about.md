# I'm Henderson Reed Hummel

and welcome to my patch of the Internet.

I am a recent Computer Science graduate (Bachelors of Science awarded June 2020), and I have interests including but not limited to:

* functional programming
* programming language design
* the game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))
* traditional wooden sailboats
* free and open source software (free as in Freedom)
* woodworking
* the beauty of the weird and whimsical web

I, together with a few friends, contribute to [Terra](https://terra.finzdani.net), a web directory we curate.

Check out some of the [music I like](/~hhummel/pages/music.html)

If you're looking for software that I've written, check out my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/hendersonreed)

Finally, if you're looking for the old website (there's some records of things I've done there) then you can find it [here](/~hhummel/old-site/index.html).
