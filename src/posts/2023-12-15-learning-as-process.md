# learning as process, not as a goal

Kids can learn things so unbelievably well, without even trying it seems. Have you ever seen a child play a video game they picked up and learned on their own, without any support, curriculum, or assistance? It's shocking how proficient an 8-year-old can get at something with no help or guidance.

I think this may be the strongest argument against compulsory education. But, that's really not what I'm here to talk about.

I'm more interested in how this demonstrates learning as a *process* and not as a *goal*. There is an intrinsic goal to any game, but no child plays Mario to literally defeat Bowser and save Princess Peach. They play Mario *in order to play Mario*.

A good example of this is physical education. Physical education for kids is always in the form of games, of activities, of things that are enriching for their own sake. Physical education for adults is almost never this - it exists purely for some imagined end-state of "I;ll have a better body" or "I'll feel less pain" or whatever else motivates a particular individual.

There *are* physical activities for adults, but they never get labeled "physical education." Things like bicycling, bouldering, hiking are primarily enriching for the process, not any end-goal.

How might we explore learning-as-process in the world of computers? Something more than the lackluster gamification of DuoLingo or other types of "edutainment."
