# Tools that are "ready-to-hand"

Some tools feel *good*, like they are a part of you. Other tools somehow never reach that capacity, even after many hours of use and a complete understanding of their workings. Let's talk about that.

## some background and definitions

In reading Sofia Autry's excellent *Art in the Age of Machine Learning*, she references Heidegger's concept of something being ["ready-to-hand"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#Ready-to-hand) (I promise, this doesn't get *too* philosophical.)

This is, in broad strokes, the condition of an entity that allows it to stop being something external to us. Rather, something that's "ready-to-hand" becomes a part of us during use. The example often quoted is that of a hammer. In our hand, the hammer ceases to feel like a distinct part of the external world but rather feels like a part of ourselves.

Heidegger also outlines three main ways an entity can be considered "unready-to-hand". It can be conspicuous (damaged), obtrusive (incomplete), or obstinate (the entity is a hindrance to our goal.)

This term, "ready-to-hand", turns out to be exactly the concept I've been looking for when trying to describe my interests in the world of interaction design. Our digital experiences are mediated exclusively by external tools that land all over the spectrum of "readiness". What qualities encourage readiness versus unreadiness?

## A few examples from across the spectrum:

Tools that feel ready-to-hand are ones that feel like they disappear when I'm using them. These are (for me):
- text editors (I find CLI tools in particular often feel ready-to-hand to me.)
- Markdown
- Instagram (this one is much TOO ready-to-hand for many.)
- point-of-sale systems (the professional sort used by cashiers, not self-checkout systems)

Tools that are unready-to-hand often feel like they're getting in my way, even after I've been using them for years. These might be:
- Zoom
- frequently changing interfaces 
- self-checkout point-of-sale systems

While digital tools can suffer from the conspicuous and obtrusive aspects of unreadiness, I think more often we come across tools that feel obstinate and opposed to our use, drawing us out of the state of "flow" that is so enjoyable for us.

## What makes a tool feel ready-to-hand?

I think what makes a tool ready-to-hand comes down to three primary aspects:
- alignment of intent
- consistency
- capacity for muscle memory

Let's talk about these one at a time.

### alignment of intent

This is most easily described with the point-of-sale system example (I used to work as a cashier, so I *do* have some expertise here.)

Self-checkout systems serve two masters (or maybe even three). They are first and foremost beholden to the company using them, and so theft prevention is a top priority. This is why they often have cameras, sensitive and flaky scales, and randomly select you for "assistance" to check that you aren't stealing. In second place, they serve the customer, and provide the bare essentials to scan your items (slowly). A potential third audience is the self-checkout attendant, who has a few different needs from the tool, the primary one of which is to dismiss the interruptions that the POS system adds to the checkout process.

What makes cashier-oriented POS systems different is that the needs of the cashier and the designers of the system are totally aligned. Both want the cashier to be able to enter items accurately at speed. This alignment of intent means that sacrifices on other, less central aspects of the system are agreeable to both parties.

### consistency

Here we can talk a little about `vim` (or `emacs`, or `grep`, or one of any number of other venerable CLI tools.) These tools are *done*. Little further development is necessary, and so one feels confident using them wherever they are available.

`vim` behaves as you expect it to, even when it's `vi` or `nvim`. It is in this pursuit of consistency that enthusiasts have crafted `vim` keybinding extensions for every editor worth its salt, and even web browsers and shells (`set -o vi` anyone?)

In contrast, consider the outcry from dedicated users of a website or tool at the prospect of any UI redesign. *Yes*, sometimes a UI redesign is necessary and results in a tool becoming more ready. But that increase in readiness must be worth the tradeoff caused by the inconsistency of the redesign.

### capacity for muscle memory

This is closely linked to the above quality, but distinct in important ways. I begin here with the hot take: *all pointing interfaces fail to adequately leverage muscle memory*. By "pointing interface" I mean most touch screen and mouse interfaces in which the primary interaction is identifying an element and tapping/clicking it.

Consider the experience of driving a car. A car is a tool that rapidly becomes "ready to hand" for serious users. And it does so because almost the entire interface is reliant upon muscle memory. Musical instruments benefit from the same. And, I posit, so do keyboard-driven interfaces.

Most pointing interfaces cannot leverage muscle memory because they lacks consistency; the size and position of interactive elements depends on window size and position. Smartphones are the primary exception to this rule because applications are always full-size and often leverage gestures, resulting in interfaces that are suitable for building muscle memory.

# so where now?

I think that as a designer of tools, our primary responsibility is to understand these aspects of our creations. There are no shortcuts to making tools that feel "ready-to-hand." But I do think that we can avoid some of the big potholes on our way there, by understanding what make our tools obstinate and unready.
