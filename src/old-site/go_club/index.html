		<h4>Go - an ancient game of strategy</h4>
    <p>
    Here at PSU I helped start an American Go Foundation recognized Go Club in the Spring term of 2019. We meet weekly in various places at PSU on Thursdays at 5:30 and typically are there until 7:30 or later.

    <h5>about the game</h5>
    <p>
    Go (or igo {the original Japanese term}, baduk {the Korean term}, or weiqi {the Chinese term}) is an ancient game, with the first known instances of it appearing 2000 years ago in China. For a long time being a competent Go player was considered an important aspect of a well-rounded education, and was a mark of status in East Asian cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the modern day, Go still enjoys a very large playerbase, and until 2015 had the distinction of being one of the few games at which AI isn't better than human intelligence. Now however, you can see the professional players learning and training off of AI games.
