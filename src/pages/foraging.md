# Foraging

I've long been interested in foraging. There's something delightful about tramping through the forest and harvesting the bounties that litter the earth, so often unseen or ignored.

This page is a log of the more interesting foraging finds I've found, along with some not-really-artful photos.

*note: do not attempt to teach yourself foraging. Find a local foraging group or mycological society and attend group forays and classes to learn the ropes. Even experienced mushroom hunters make mistakes, sometimes resulting in sickness or death.*

### odd merged *Boletacea*

Likely *Xerocomellus*, these little guys appear to have merged early on.

### *Laetiporus sp.*

This type is considered fine eating in Europe and the northeastern United States and commonly named one of the "foolproof four" (however, no foraged mushrooms are truly foolproof.) It *can* cause allergic reactions in some people, particularly the types that grow on the West Coast and those that grow on conifers on the East Coast.

This specimen was found on conifers in the Pacific Northwest and therefore is likely *Laetiporus conifericola*. I ate just a couple bites and felt a mild reaction, probably due to undercooking (it's much meatier and denser than your typical choice edible mushroom, so requires more cooking than I thought.) Recommended practice is 15 minutes boiling, which I'll be testing next.

### *Rubroboletus pulcherrimus*

This genus is nearly all somewhat poisonous, and generally distinctive due to the red coloring, blue staining when bruised, and red pore surface. This particular species is one of the only Boletaceae that are known to have caused deaths (just two species in the family have ever been implicated in deaths.)
