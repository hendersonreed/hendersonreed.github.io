# independent interface programmer for hire.

I believe there is tremendous potential to be gained in a re-evaluation of how we interact with computers. The infinitely malleable, powerfully transformative technologies we use in our day-to-day aren't used at their capacity, and wasted human time, energy, and capital is the result. Iâ€™m passionate about reducing wasted human time and making software tools more innately fulfilling, reliable, and user-respecting.

To these ends, I do interaction-focused work on user-centric projects. This includes:

- developer tooling (the software development and deployment process has a user-interface just like any other process.)
- creative tool development (graphic design software, AI-powered creative tooling, music software/hardware.)
- creative technology applications (both hardware and software, in marketing and artistic contexts.)

I work on a project basis or on retainer and I am currently taking on new clients. Spots are limited.

If this sounds like work you need done, please [email me](mailto:reed.hummel@gmail.com) with a brief description of the problems you need solved, and we will take it from there.
