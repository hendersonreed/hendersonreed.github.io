# programmer for hire

Hello there, are you looking for me?

I believe there is tremendous potential to be gained in a re-evaluation of how we interact with computers. To that end, I've been [working](/pages/projects/). I'm passionate about reducing wasted human time and making software tools more innately fulfilling, reliable, and user-respecting.

I have limited spots open at this time, but am taking clients who need interaction-focused work on user-centric projects. This means:

- developer tooling (the software development and deployment process has a user-interface just like any other process.)
- creative tools (graphic design software, AI-powered creative tooling, music software/hardware.)
- creative technology (both hardware and software, in marketing and artistic contexts.)

If this sounds like the sort of work you need done, please [email me](mailto:reed.hummel@gmail.com) with a description of the work.
