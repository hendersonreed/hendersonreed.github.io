## The Computer Art Crew: The CAC.

- what: making fun/weird stuff with computers
- when: currently undecided (probably Wednesdays?)
- where: currently undecided (maybe Common Grounds Coffeeshop?)

### details:

Every week, the CAC meets to make some weird stuff with computers. Some call this [software art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_art), [new media art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art), or [digital poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_poetry). [Computer art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art) is a nice catch-all though.

### social rules

Please read [these](/pages/events/social-rules.html) before joining us. No, really, it's a requirement.

### structure

Each meeting follows the same structure:

- a prompt is read out by the organizer.
- around the table folks have the opportunity to talk about what they're planning on making that day (15 minutes)
- for the next 90 minutes folks program (optionally in small groups.)
- at the end there's a chance for folks to demo their work, time allowing.

You're welcome to use whatever language or tools you want.

Don't feel restricted to making something visual, "artistic", or even related to the prompt. This is an opportunity to build something just for fun.

A common and beginner-friendly choice of technology is [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which has an [online editor](https://editor.p5.js)

#### for beginners

For absolute beginners with no programming experience, you're still encouraged to come! Some additional beginner materials might be useful, to acquaint you with some of the basic ideas behind programming:

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)


Consider pair-programming with others to build familiarity with these new tools and concepts. And of course, feel free to ask for help.
