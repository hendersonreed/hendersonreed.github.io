# Join me at some local events!

## my calendar

I'm trying to attend more local tech events in Portland, Oregon where I live, and I'd like to bring folks along. **If you want to join me at local events, consider adding this calendar to your own** (there's a little + icon at the lower right corner to add it to your own Google calendar.) It tracks all the local events that I'm interested in attending. I can't be at all of these events, so if you're interested in chatting with me IRL, consider [contacting me](/pages/contact.html) to coordinate.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the interesting tech events going on in Portland, just what I'm currently interested in attending.

## SUDO events

The Society for Unrealized Digital Occurrences (SUDO) is a loose organization of programmers, artists, thinkers, and enthusiasts working on a variety of topics, operating in Portland, Oregon.

Currently, it's comprised of two regularly occurring events:

- the [HCIANMDG](/pages/events/hcianmdg.html) is a discussion group about humans, computers, and how we interact with them. This gets pretty deep into the philosophical weeds - more end-user programming and digital culture, less Fitt's law and UI frameworks.
- the [CCN](/pages/events/ccn.html) is a regularly-occurring informal hackathon. Get together, program something new for 2 hours, and (optionally) demo to your peers at the end.
