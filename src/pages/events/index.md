# Join me at some local events!

## my calendar

Portland has some great tech events, but they're spread out across a few platforms or just by word of mouth. So, I'm trying to build my own calendar of events that I'm interested in attending. You can see what I've saved in this embedded Google calendar:

I can't be at all of these events, so if you're interested in chatting with me IRL, consider [contacting me](/pages/contact.html) to coordinate.

## events I run

Currently I'm just running the [HCIANMDG](/pages/events/hcianmdg.html).

Down the line, I'd like to run a weekly creative coding session for computer folks who want a low-commitment regular creative outlet. This would be a regular, time-boxed (2-3 hours) event where everyone works in the same physical space to build little creative coding demos or toys on the same theme. Themes change week-to-week, and we do a little brainstorming at the beginning and then folks get to demo at the end.
