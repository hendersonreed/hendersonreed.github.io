# Join me at some local events!

## my calendar

Portland has some great tech events, but they're spread out across a few platforms or just by word of mouth. So, I'm trying to build my own calendar of events that I'm interested in attending. You can see what I've saved in this embedded Google calendar:

I can't be at all of these events, so if you're interested in chatting with me IRL, consider [contacting me](/pages/contact.html) to coordinate.

## events I run

Currently I'm running two events on a weekly basis.

- the [HCIANMDG](/pages/events/hcianmdg.html)
- the [SUDO](/pages/events/sudo.html).
