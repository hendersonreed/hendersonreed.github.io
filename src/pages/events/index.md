# Join me at some local events!

## my calendar

I'm trying to attend more local tech events in Portland, Oregon where I live, and I'd like to bring folks along. In that effort, I'm sharing my own personal "join me at events" calendar so that folks who want to meet up at events can see what I'm planning on attending or think is interesting.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the interesting tech events going on in Portland, just what I'm currently interested in attending.

I can't be at all of these events, so if you're interested in chatting with me IRL, consider [contacting me](/pages/contact.html) to coordinate.

## events I run

Currently I'm running two events on a weekly basis.

- the [HCIANMDG](/pages/events/hcianmdg.html) is a discussion group about humans, computers, and how we interact with them. This gets pretty deep in the phisolophical weeds - think interaction paradigms and digital culture, not Fitt's law and UI frameworks.
- the [SUDO](/pages/events/sudo.html) is like a sip-and-paint but for programming. Get together, program something new for a couple of hours, and (optionally) demo to your peers at the end.
