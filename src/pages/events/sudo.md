## The Society for Unrealized Digital Occurences: SUDO

- what: making fun/weird stuff with computers
- when: Wednesday evenings from 6pm to 8pm.
- where: currently undecided

### details:

Every week, the SUDO meets to make some weird stuff with computers. Some call this [software art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_art), [new media art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art), [digital poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_poetry), or [computer art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art).

### social rules

Read [these](/pages/events/social-rules.html) before joining us.

If someone is regularly breaking those social rules, or is otherwise making attendees uncomfortable or being especially unpleasant, they will be asked to stop attending.

Please contact me if you see this happening.

### structure

Each meeting follows the same structure:

- a prompt is read out by the organizer.
- around the table folks have the opportunity to talk about what they're planning on making that day (15 minutes)
- for the next 90 minutes folks program (optionally in small groups.)
- at the end there's a chance for folks to demo their work, time allowing.

You're welcome to use whatever language or tools you want.

Don't feel restricted to making something visual, "artistic", or even related to the prompt. This is an opportunity to build something just for fun.

### technologies to inspire

#### for beginners

For absolute beginners with no programming experience, you're still encouraged to come! Some additional beginner materials might be useful, to acquaint you with some of the basic ideas behind programming:

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
- [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org) is a tiny beginner game engine for little story games.
    - a [tutorial](https://www.shimmerwitch.space/bitsyTutorial.html)


Consider pair-programming with others to build familiarity with these new tools and concepts. And of course, feel free to ask for help.
