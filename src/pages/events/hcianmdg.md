**Details:**

Are you interested in *why* and *how* we use computers? Do you think often about radical reshapings of the digital landscape? Love projects from MIT Media Lab and NYC ITP?

The HCIANMDG (also known as the human-computer-interface and new media discussion group) is a space for software-adjacent folks to talk about the future of computers, their interfaces, and their applications. We meet every week on Monday at Oakshire Brewing on NE 42nd to read papers, talk about projects, share our work, and/or grumble/wax poetic about the future of computing.

A few definitions, to start us off:
    
*human computer interface*:

- we're using this in the broadest possible sense, far beyond just the realm of web-browsers, front-end frameworks, or GUI toolkits. Examples include: hardware interfaces, interactive art pieces, and digital fabrication tooling.

*new media*:
    
- also sometimes called "programmatic media", this is media that exists in both computational and physical contexts, often with distinct but connected aspects. 
    - this includes technologies both familiar (e.g. hyperlinked media (a *very* novel concept, historically speaking) and unfamiliar (the cybernetic fads of the 1950s.)
    - check out [the wikipedia page on new media for another good overview.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media).
    - See also [Lev Manovich's "New Media: A User's Guide" (1999)](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/new-media-a-user-s-guide) for a more in-depth overview of the history/explanation of the field.

### reading:

I'll come each week with a few questions and quotes prepared from some reading (see the list below.) **There's no obligation on the part of attendees to do any reading**, but it's encouraged and fun if you do! Consider bringing a printout of whatever you read so we can pass it around.
