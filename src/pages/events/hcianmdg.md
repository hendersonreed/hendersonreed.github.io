**Details:**

Are you interested in *why* and *how* we use computers? Do you think often about radical reshapings of the digital landscape? Love projects from MIT Media Lab and NYC ITP?

Come check out the HCIANMDG (human-computer interface and new media discussion group)! We meet every week on Monday at Oakshire Brewing on NE 42nd to read papers, talk about projects, share our work, and grumble/wax poetic about the future of computing.

I'll come with a few questions and quotes prepared from some reading. There's no obligation on the part of attendees to do any reading. A sample of things we might talk about:

- selections from *The New Media Reader*
- *Computer as Theatre* by Brenda Laurel
- *The Medium is the Massage* by Marshall McLuhan
- *Art in the Age of Machine Learning* by Sofian Audry
