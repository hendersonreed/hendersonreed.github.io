# HCIANMDG

## human-computer-interface and new media discussion group

- What: We're meeting to talk about new media and user interfaces!
- When: Every Monday at 6pm (first meeting planned for Monday April 15.)
- Where: *usually* [Oakshire Brewing Portland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sRFovi91jAFXRPMDA), except for the second Monday of each month, when we meet at [CTRL-H](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RsKctWzYtGKqUqtH9), North Portland's hackerspace for [dorkbot PDX](https://dorkbotpdx.org).

**Details:**

Are you interested in *why* and *how* we use computers? Do you think often about radical reshapings of the digital landscape? Love projects from MIT Media Lab and NYC ITP?

The HCIANMDG (also known as the human-computer-interface and new media discussion group) is a space for software-adjacent folks to talk about the future of computers, their interfaces, and their applications. We meet every week on Monday at Oakshire Brewing on NE 42nd to read papers, talk about projects, share our work, and/or grumble/wax poetic about the future of computing.

A few definitions, to start us off:
    
*human computer interface*:

- we're using this in the broadest possible sense, far beyond just the realm of web-browsers, front-end frameworks, or GUI toolkits. Examples include: hardware interfaces, interactive art pieces, and digital fabrication tooling.

*new media*:
    
- also sometimes called "programmatic media", this is media that exists in both computational and physical contexts, often with distinct but connected aspects. 
    - this includes technologies both familiar (e.g. hyperlinked media (a *very* novel concept, historically speaking) and unfamiliar (the cybernetic fads of the 1950s.)
    - check out [the wikipedia page on new media for another good overview.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media).
    - See also [Lev Manovich's "New Media: A User's Guide" (1999)](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/new-media-a-user-s-guide) for a more in-depth overview of the history/explanation of the field.


### 4 simple rules for joining us:

The goal here is to build a friendly, intellectually respectful, productive space. So there are a few guidelines[^1]:

- No well-actually’s
    - A well-actually is when you interject to say something that’s not relevant to the conversation or tangential to what someone else is trying to say. They’re not helpful, they break the flow of conversation, and they focus attention on the person making the well-actually.
- No feigned surprise
    - feigning surprise is when you act surprised when someone doesn’t know something. Responding with surprise in this situation makes people feel bad for not knowing things and less likely to ask questions in the future, which makes it harder for them to learn.
- No backseat driving
    - Backseat driving is when you lob advice from across the room (or across the online chat) without really joining or engaging in a conversation. Because you haven’t been participating in the conversation, it’s easy to miss something important and give advice that’s not actually helpful. Even if your advice is correct, it’s rude to bust into a conversation without asking. If you overhear a conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask to join.
- No subtle -isms
    - Subtle -isms are subtle expressions of bias and prejudice. They are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake.
    - "Python is so easy to use, even my mom can program with it!"

These social rules are lightweight. You should not be afraid of breaking a social rule. These are things that everyone does, and breaking one doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone says, "hey, you just feigned surprise," or "that’s subtly sexist," don’t worry. Just apologize, reflect for a second, and move on.

I'll come each week with a few questions and quotes prepared from some reading (see the list below.) **There's no obligation on the part of attendees to do any reading**, but it's encouraged and fun if you do! Consider bringing a printout of whatever you read so we can pass it around.
