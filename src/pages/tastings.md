# Tasting

There's something I find particularly delightful about running tastings. Either blind taste tests, in which the goal is to identify the differences between foods and perhaps a personally preferred form of something, and also more general tastings where we're exploring the realm of taste.

This page is a record of the tastings I've been doing.

## general records of wine

### red
- [2020 La Quercia Montepulciano D'Abruzzo](https://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=4097870)
    - really tasty, a great wine to pair with food. Relatively mild, lots of fruit notes, medium body, not too tannic.
    - I think a great beginner wine, but still satisfying.
- [West Wines Cabernet Sauvignon Bushwood Estates](https://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=3093541)
    - fruit forward, somewhat spicy, also good with food.
    - not sure which year.
    - started me on my Cabernet Sauvignon kick.
- [2022 Caves Vidigal Vinho Regional Lisboa Porta 6](https://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=4631270)
    - really excellent. Don't remember too many notes, but certainly some spice and fruit.

### white

- [2021 Loosen Brothers Riesling Dr. L](https://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=4298399)
    -  quite sweet, tons of fruit notes, just enough acidity to not make it too cloying. Peachy, tart, maybe a little apple?

## head-to-head: Jalapeno Potato Chips

The only thing I remember from this tasting is that Tim's Jalapeno chips was the best by far.

## head-to-head: Vegan Cream Cheese

This one was conducted months ago, but the conclusions were, in broad strokes:

1. Violife (tasted *extremely* cheesy, it's wild. I'm not even vegan and I'm not sure I could tell the difference.)
2. Nuurish (contains non-animal whey, so not suitable for folks with dairy allergies.)
3. Kite Hill (potentially a lower-than-typical rating, as the samples had been in my fridge for a bit before the others.)
4. Tofutti (a powerfully beany undertone that is surprisingly difficult to hide with other flavors.)
5. Miyoko's (a weirdly strong vinegar taste, and an odd color and texture places this solidly in last place.)
