# Tasting

There's something I find particularly delightful about running tastings. Either blind taste tests, in which the goal is to identify the differences between foods and perhaps a personally preferred form of something, and also more general tastings where we're exploring the realm of taste.

This page is a record of the tastings I've been doing.

## tournament style: Root Beers

This is beginning to get out of hand, so much so that my partner has created a spreadsheet to track our results.

I'll record just a few key notes here:

- A&W is by far the best of the big three (Mug, Barq's, A&W).
- Shasta follows closely behind A&W.
- Bundaberg Root Beer is beautifully delicious, perhaps my favorite, but maybe too bitter and cola-like for most root beer fans.

Some of the classics that you *think* would be really great turn out to be quite disappointing when put up against others. Both Dad's and Henry Weinhards lost in the first round.

## head-to-head: Jalapeno Potato Chips

The only thing I remember from this tasting is that Tim's Jalapeno chips was the best by far.

## head-to-head: Vegan Cream Cheese

This one was conducted months ago, but the conclusions were, in broad strokes:

1. Violife (tasted *extremely* cheesy, it's wild. I'm not even vegan and I'm not sure I could tell the difference.)
2. Nuurish (contains non-animal whey, so not suitable for folks with dairy allergies.)
3. Kite Hill (potentially a lower-than-typical rating, as the samples had been in my fridge for a bit before the others.)
4. Tofutti (a powerfully beany undertone that is surprisingly difficult to hide with other flavors.)
5. Miyoko's (a weirdly strong vinegar taste, and an odd color and texture places this solidly in last place.)
