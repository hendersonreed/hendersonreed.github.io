# tooling developer for hire.

Hi there! I'm Henderson Reed Hummel, and I think computers have so much more potential.

The infinitely malleable, powerfully transformative, and *fun* technologies we use in our day-to-day aren't being used at their capacity. Iâ€™m passionate about reducing wasted human time and making software tools more innately fulfilling, reliable, and user-respecting.

Check out some of my work:

- [psg](psg.html)

Less serious projects can be found [here.](/pages/projects/index.html)

I'm currently open to new opportunities, so if you're hiring in this space, please [email me](mailto:reed.hummel@gmail.com).
