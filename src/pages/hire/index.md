# independent interface programmer for hire.

Hi there! I'm Henderson Reed Hummel, and I think computers have so much more potential.

The infinitely malleable, powerfully transformative, and *fun* technologies we use in our day-to-day aren't being used at their capacity. Iâ€™m passionate about reducing wasted human time and making software tools more innately fulfilling, reliable, and user-respecting.

To these ends, I do interaction-focused work on user-centric projects. This includes:

- developer tooling (the software development and deployment process has a user-interface just like any other process.)
- creative tool development (graphic design software, AI-powered creative tooling, music software/hardware.)
- creative technology applications (both hardware and software, in marketing and artistic contexts.)

Check out some of my work:

If this sounds like work you need done, please [email me](mailto:reed.hummel@gmail.com) with a brief description of the work.
