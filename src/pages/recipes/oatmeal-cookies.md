# My mom's oatmeal cookies

These are the cookies my mom always made us growing up. They're mostly oats, and require very few ingredients. They are somewhat "healthy", in a granola kind of way.

This recipe makes around 9 medium cookies.

## ingredients:

- 150g oats
- 4g salt
- 65g sugar
- 115g self-raising flour (can be substituted, as this is really just pre-mixed flour and baking powder.)
- 50g fat of some sort (melted butter works, vegetable oil, even olive oil would probably be fine.)
- 120g water (or milk, oat milk, almond milk, etc.)
- chocolate chips as desired.

### optional add-ins

- walnuts
- sunflower seeds
- dried cranberries
- almonds

## process:

1. begin heating your oven to 375F.
1. mix your dry ingredients (not including chocolate chips)
2. add your fat, and work it into the dry ingredients. It should form a sort of sandy, pebbly mixture. Use your hands to ensure there are no large clumps.
3. add your wet ingredients.
4. add your chocolate chips (around 150g is a good amount.)
5. portion onto a parchment-lined baking sheet into 9 equal scoops.
6. bake for 18-22 minutes, removing once the craggy bits are starting to get golden.
