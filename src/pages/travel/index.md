# Traveling

I'm hoping to track my travels more carefully, and I think I'll try to use this page as a general index of my trips.

## Japan

In June/July of 2024, I visited [Japan](japan.html) for the first time. We spent around 7 days in Tokyo, and 5 days in Kamakura (with a single day-trip to the nearby island of Enoshima, which was a highlight of the whole trip.)
