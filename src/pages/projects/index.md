I'm working on building more projects I'm proud to share with the world. For now, here are some:

- [hark: a literature visualizer](hark.html).
    - this is a little script that visualizes recurring 4/5/6-word phrases in a given piece of literature. Some public domain text is included as an example.
- [psg: python site generator](https://github.com/hendersonreed/psg.py)
    - this is the primary tool used to build this site. There are a few additional scripts tracked alongside the website source itself for things like backing-up-and-resizing images and generating the page sitemap, but `psg` is the biggest part.
