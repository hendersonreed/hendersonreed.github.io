I've been getting so many ideas lately, I've been forced to write them down so I can stop thinking about them for a little bit. Find them at [todo](todo.html)

I'm working on building more projects I'm proud to share with the world. For now, here are some:

- [hark: a literature visualizer](hark.html).
    - this is a little script that visualizes recurring 4/5/6-word phrases in a given piece of literature. Some public domain text is included as an example.
- [psg: python site generator](https://github.com/hendersonreed/psg.py)
    - this is the primary tool used to build this site. There are a few additional scripts tracked alongside the website source itself for things like backing-up-and-resizing images and generating the page sitemap, but `psg` is the biggest part.
- [pyplot: for poking at vintage plotters](/posts/2023-10-23-building-pyplot.html)
    - this is a small utility I wrote for feeding larger HPGL files into vintage plotters with limited buffer size.
- [colorworm!!](colorworm.html)
    - I like to make little doohickeys in p5.js. This was created as part of an [exquisite corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse) with me and my friend [Lucas](https://lucaslija.github.io/)
