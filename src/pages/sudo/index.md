# Join me at some local events!
## SUDO events

The Society for Unrealized Digital Occurrences (SUDO) is a loose organization of programmers, artists, thinkers, and alternative computing enthusiasts working on a variety of topics, operating in Portland, Oregon.

Currently, it's comprised of two regularly occurring events:

- the [HCIANMDG](/pages/sudo/hcianmdg.html) is a discussion group about humans, computers, and how we interact with them. This gets pretty deep into the philosophical weeds - more end-user programming and digital culture, less Fitt's law and UI frameworks.
- the [CCN](/pages/sudo/ccn.html) is a regularly-occurring informal hackathon. Get together, program something new for 2 hours, and (optionally) demo to your peers at the end.

## SUDO calendar

See below to see the next meeting and any cancellations. Occasionally other meetings that I'm interested in will be posted to the SUDO calendar. If you're interested in joining me, contact me to coordinate.
