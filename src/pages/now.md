# Now

This page shares what I'm doing and thinking. Inspired by the [now pages of other people.](https://nownownow.com/)

## as of December 2025:

### doing

- throwing a lot of pots in my ceramics studio. At a community studio I'm in, we have access to high-fire gas reduction firing, and it's a real joy. So I'm working out how to reduction fire in the home studio without dropping an exorbitant of money on a gas kiln.
- gardening. I recently got an actual yard after years of apartment living, and so now I'm very much enjoying planting all kinds of ornamentals and edibles both.
- building computer community - I'm part of a local group that puts on events and holds a discussion group about computer topics, [The SUDO](https://the-sudo.net).
- teaching a course about AI and ML in the arts at my local community college.

### thinking about

- spatial computing, like [DynamicLand](https://dynamicland.org/) and [Folk Computer](https://folk.computer/)
- what makes technology feel actively _healthy_, (i.e. feels like it helps us in our mission of being happy humans?)
- knowledge management - we have more knowledge than ever to review, and it is impossible to read every interesting article and watch every interesting video. How do we handle it all?
- the Tao - some commentary I read on the Tao describes it as akin to the new moon; a philosophy of potential and a cyclical nature.
