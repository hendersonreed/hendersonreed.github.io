# I'm Henderson Reed Hummel

and welcome to my patch of the Internet.

I'm currently at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), exploring esoteric user interfaces, music programming, and the weird web.

My interests include (but aren't limited to):

* the analogue/digital divide
* electronic music
* functional programming
* programming language design
* the game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))
* wooden sailboats
* free and open source software
* hand tool woodworking
* the beauty of the weird and whimsical web

I, together with a few friends, contribute to [Terra](https://terra.finzdani.net), a web directory we curate.

Check out some of the [music I like](/pages/music.html)

I've got some [book recommendations](/pages/books.html)

I love to cook, I'm currently adding some [recipes](/pages/recipes/) to this personal page.

## programming

- my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/hendersonreed). 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/hendersonreed).

Finally, if you're looking for my old university website (there's some records of things I've done there) then you can find it [here](/old-site/index.html).
