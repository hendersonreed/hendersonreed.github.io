# Howdy!

I'm Henderson Reed Hummel, and welcome to my patch of the Internet (you can call me Henderson or Reed).

I'm a programmer and prototyper exploring esoteric user interfaces, music programming, and the weird web.

In 2023 I completed a batch at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and found it lifechanging. Consider doing one!

I'm currently employed by [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com), and am working on configuration management tooling there (lots of hardware to configure!)

<div class="index-container" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden">
<div class="index-interests">
My interests include (but aren't limited to):

* the analog/digital divide
* how interfaces influence our mindsets
* building wooden sailboats
* free and open source software
* hand tool woodworking
* digital fabrication
* foraging for mushrooms
* the beauty of the weird and whimsical web
* electronic musical instruments (and acoustic ones too)
* the game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))
* functional programming languages and their design
* hobbyist electronics
* film photography

Finally, if you're looking for my old university website (there's some records of things I've done there) then you can find it [here](/old-site/index.html).
