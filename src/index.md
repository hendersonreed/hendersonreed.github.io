# Howdy!

I'm Henderson Reed Hummel, and welcome to my patch of the Internet.

I'm a programmer and prototyper exploring esoteric user interfaces, music programming, and the weird web.

My interests include (but aren't limited to):

* the analogue/digital divide
* how interfaces influence our mindsets
* building wooden sailboats
* free and open source software
* hand tool woodworking
* digital fabrication
* the beauty of the weird and whimsical web
* electronic music
* the game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))
* functional programming
* programming language design
* hobbyist electronics
