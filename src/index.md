# Howdy!

I'm Henderson Reed Hummel, and welcome to my patch of the Internet.

I'm a programmer and prototyper exploring esoteric user interfaces, music programming, and the weird web.

I've just completed a batch at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and found it lifechanging. Consider doing one!

My interests include (but aren't limited to):

* the analogue/digital divide
* how interfaces influence our mindsets
* building wooden sailboats
* free and open source software
* hand tool woodworking
* digital fabrication
* the beauty of the weird and whimsical web
* electronic music
* the game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))
* functional programming
* programming language design
* hobbyist electronics

Check out some of the [music I like](/pages/music.html)

I've got some [book recommendations](/pages/books.html)

I love to cook, I'm currently adding some [recipes](/pages/recipes/) to this personal page.
